### What are people saying about the HubSpot plugin?

> “HubSpot was a big factor in helping us scale WP Buffs to $1M in revenue. Their plugin and sales CRM made our sales process so much more professional and kept us fully organized as we grew from 1 salesperson to 4. Plus, the reporting dashboards allow me to know where our sales game is strong and where we can still improve with just a few clicks. Needless to say, I'm all in on HubSpot.” – **Joe Howard, Founder & CEO, WP Buffs**

> “HubSpot educates marketers beyond just the anonymous web analytics they get from Google Analytics. Instead, it digs down to individual users.” – **Michael Shoup, Founder / CEO, 12South Marketing**

> “HubSpot dramatically cuts down the time I spend on marketing. We used to spend tons of time generating very few inbound leads, but those numbers have gone through the roof with minimal effort.” – **Brian Ruhlmann, Director of Sales & Marketing, AdmitHub**
