Take credit card payments on your store using Stripe.

== Description ==

Changing consumer behavior has resulted in an explosion of payment methods and experiences, which are great for increasing conversion and lowering costs—but can be difficult for businesses to maintain. Give customers a best-in-class checkout experience while you remain focused on your core business. This is the official plugin created by Stripe and WooCommerce.

The enhanced checkout experience from Stripe can help customers:

- **Boost conversion:** Provide an optimal experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop with a responsive checkout, and offer 23 payment methods, including [Link](https://stripe.com/payments/link), [Apple Pay](https://woocommerce.com/apple-pay/), and [Google Pay](https://www.google.com/payments/solutions/), out of the box.
- **Expand your customer base:** Convert customers who might otherwise abandon their cart with buy now, pay later methods like Klarna, Affirm, and Afterpay/Clearpay, wallets like Apple Pay, Google Pay, Alipay, and WeChat Pay, and local payment methods such as Bancontact in Europe and Alipay in Asia Pacific. Deliver a localized payment experience with out-of-the-box support for localized error messages, right-to-left languages, and automatic adjustment of input fields based on payment method and country.
- **Meet existing customer demand and localize the experience:** Offer [local payment methods](https://stripe.com/guides/payment-methods-guide), such as Bancontact, Boleto, Cash App Pay, EPS, giropay, iDEAL, Multibanco, OXXO, Przelewy 24, and SEPA Direct Debit.
- **Fight fraud:** Detect and prevent fraud with [Stripe Radar](https://stripe.com/radar), which offers seamlessly integrated, powerful fraud-detection tools that use machine learning to detect and flag potentially fraudulent transactions.
- **Accept in-person payments for products and services:** Use the Stripe Terminal M2 card reader or get started with no additional hardware using Tap to Pay on iPhone, or Tap to Pay on Android.
- **Support subscriptions:** Support recurring payments with various payment methods via [WooCommerce Subscriptions](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/).
- **Manage cash flow:** Get paid within minutes with Stripe Instant Payouts, if eligible.
- **Achieve [PCI-DSS](https://docs.stripe.com/security) compliance with [Stripe Elements](https://stripe.com/payments/elements) hosted input fields.**
