## Advantage over alternative solutions

### Only one plugin needed

Without a GTM plugin, you would need a separate plugin for each of those integrations. Each plugin can track events differently. They can cause conflicts and slow-down on the front-end

With a dedicated GTM plugin, all data is sent in standardized Google format to Google Tag Manager which forwards events to multiple destination services.

### Reporting consistency

A common problem when trying to use other GTM and Google Analytics plugins is that data can be sent twice corrupting analytics reporting. Using DataLayer is a standard way to ensure your tracking information stays consistent across all connected tools.

### Google Consent Mode v2

Using GTM and dataLayer allows to build more complex scenarios, such as only processing the data after obtaining user consent. Other plugin directly pipe events into target system no matter if required permission was given or not.


== Installation ==

1. Upload or install GTM for WooCommerce plugin from WordPress plugins directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress.
3. That's it! If GTM is already implemented in your WordPress your eCommerce data will be pushed to GTM DataLayer. If not head to `Settings > Google Tag Manager` and paste in GTM snippets.
4. Go to your Google Tag Manager workspace and define what you want to do with the tracked data. We know that settings up the GTM workspace may be cumbersome. That's why the plugin comes with a GTM container presets that you can import to your GTM workspace to create all required Tags, Triggers, and Variables in few simple clicks.

### How to use JSON file with GTM container?

In order to perform such import go to `Settings > Google Tag Manager` and click `GTM Presets` tab. Look for GTM Preset that you would like to install. Save it as a JSON file on your computer.

Then in GTM go to the `Admin` panel of your workspace. Click `Import Container`. Choose the container file you have just downloaded. Decide which workspace it should go to. Then select `Merge` and `Overwrite conflicting tags, triggers and variables.` as import options.
Hit `Confirm` to create tags, variables, and triggers for pushing Ecommerce events to the GA4 property.

The last step is to define `GA4 Measurement ID`. Go to `Variables` find a variable with the `GA4 Measurement ID` name, click to edit it. Then paste your GA4 Measurement ID in the Value field.


If you are importing `Facebook Pixel` preset you can find the tracking ID in `FBP Pixel ID` variable.

Save and submit all the changes to make it live.
